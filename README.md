# Project's Main Idea: 
The idea of this app is to manage your money & finances, allow you to see your spending by category, set up bill payments, keep track of your incomes, and plan for savings.

# Expectations: 
•	Display total cost by day, month, year.
•	Show your invoices during the day.
•	Add a new invoice.
•	Show categories (including food, water bills, etc).

# Workflow:

1.	First, in the ‘Home’ screen, you will see a dashboard which will help keep track expenses by day, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months.
2.	Next, as you click on the dashboard, the detail of expenses group by categories will appear.
3.	When you click the ‘Add New’ button, catalogs will appear. Clicking on each specific catalog will lead to the next screen where you can input the amount of money and give a description for that invoice.
4.	‘Setting’ enables users to edit their information and images.
